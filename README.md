This is a very simple project where I learned how to call and use an API in JavaScript.
It’s nothing fancy, the main goal was just to understand how API fetching works and how to handle that data in a basic web app.

I’ve added this project to my repo more as a way to document my progress, not to show off or present it as some big achievement. It’s a small step in the journey, but an important one.
And this is as an checkpoint that now I'm moving to learn react.js with ether.js.
As I'm not taking any course and lecture from paid course I'm not getting any certificate so it's imp to me to documnet every steps here on git hub as an proof of work.
